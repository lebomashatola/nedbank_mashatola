Doyle has previously played for Chesterfield, Cardiff, Preston North End, Portsmouth, Oldham Athletic, Bradford City, Swindon Town and Bolton Wanderers in England, as well as Shelbourne, Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers in his native Ireland and Hibernian in the Scottish Premier League.

Playing career
Youth
Doyle was born in Dublin and had a very successful underage career which included playing for the U15 Republic of Ireland national football team. He first began his sporting career in Gaelic Football from an early age in Dublin. He the began his underage club career at then Irish champions Shelbourne, however after three years he left for Cherry Orchard in 2001. He was widely tipped to make the move to English football within a few years as his coaches believed him to be of such a standard.

Shelbourne
Following a four-year spell with Dublin club Crumlin United, Doyle returned to Shelbourne who had just been relegated to the League of Ireland First Division. He was one of new boss Dermot Keely's first signings and was expected to make a large impact at the club. His time there was cut short and he was released midway through the 2007 season without making his league debut following a disappointing spell for him and the club.

Shamrock Rovers
Later on in the 2007 season he signed for Shamrock Rovers. He was promoted from the U21s to the senior squad during the 2007 season, making his début against Waterford United on 10 August 2007. In his first full season, 2008 League of Ireland, he netted 5 goals in 30 league appearances. His debut league goal coming against Rovers. It was speculated that he would move to a different club following former manager Pat Scully's departure however he remained at the club for the 2009 season. He was a substitute for Stephen Bradley in the first game at Tallaght Stadium. Unfortunately for Doyle he did not become a major player under new Shams manager, Michael O'Neill after the signing of Gary Twigg.

Sligo Rovers
Doyle joined Sligo Rovers on 16 July 2009. He scored on his debut in a 2–0 win over St. Patrick's Athletic. He also scored in the 2009 FAI Cup Final at Tallaght Stadium, however Rovers lost the match 2–1 to Sporting Fingal.

Doyle contributed 8 goals during the successful 2010 season that saw Rovers win both domestic cups, the FAI Cup and the EA Sports Cup. Doyle did very well when forced to play as a centre-forward in the FAI Cup final win and scored one of two penalties in the shoot-out. The 2011 season proved to be his best to date. Early on in the season he was moved into the centre-forward position. He relished the role, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Bray Wanderers and at one stage was the league's leading scorer. Doyle ended up scoring 25 goals as Rovers finished second in the league and won the 2011 FAI Cup Final. Doyle scored in the Cup Final penalty shootout, where Rovers ran out victorious 4–1 against Shelbourne. His contract with Rovers expired at the end of the season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,Defender,,,,,,,191 cm,152 lbs,0,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/3ma4rb1727085384.jpg,,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/pibwac1727085329.png,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/8y3u3k1727085434.png,,,,,,Yes,unlocked,Toal,Bolton Wanderers,EPL

Yiadom played an important role during Barnet's 2012–13 season. He was preferred as the right sided winger in Edgar Davids' 4–5–1 formation, with Ricky Holmes on the opposite wing. Yiadom became popular with fans for his pace, which he used to good effect on the wing, where he posed a threat to many opposition teams. Similar to Mark Byrne, Yiadom was used at times as a replacement right back following injuries and suspensions to first choice Barry Fuller. He started the last match at Underhill Stadium against Wycombe Wanderers, helping the Bees to a 1–0 win. His impressive performance earned him a spot in the Barnet line-up on the final match of the season against Northampton Town, though in his unnatural position of right back, with new signing Keanu Marsh-Brown being preferred to start on the right wing.

Aston Villa
After being spotted playing for local side AFC Tramore, Williams had trials for both Aston Villa and Manchester United, before signing for Villa in January 2009. Following a number of injuries to Alex McLeish's first team squad in the latter stages of the 2011–12 season, the versatile defender was brought in to train with the first team on a number of occasions. His first competitive involvement with the first team saw him earn a place on the bench for the defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea, and the draw with Liverpool.

Williams made his first-team debut under Paul Lambert, as a substitute in Villa's 1–1 Premier League draw against Queens Park Rangers on 1 December 2012. Williams played a part in the Aston Villa Under-19s' successful NextGen Series 2012–13 campaign.

Bristol City
After struggling to make it into the Aston Villa first team, Williams signed for Bristol City, newly relegated to League One, on a three-year contract on 24 June 2013.

Williams made his debut in a 2–0 away win at Gillingham in the League Cup on 6 August, and continued to solidify his place in the line up, starting almost every league game for City that season. His first professional goal came on 15 February 2014, in a 2–2 draw at home to Tranmere Rovers.

Bristol City started the 2014–15 League One season with a 16-game unbeaten run, a club record, and the second longest unbeaten run in the country at the time, only behind Chelsea. Williams was a key fixture in this run, starting every game. His first goal of the season came in this run, in a 3–2 home win over Chesterfield on 11 October, and his second was scored in a Football League Trophy win over Coventry City in early December. Williams was sent off for the first time in his career in a 1–0 away defeat at the hands of Crewe Alexandra, forcing him to miss the following game. After returning from his one-match ban, Williams continued to feature on the left of City's three man defence, alongside Aden Flint and Luke Ayling. Williams played in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium on 22 March 2015, a game in which City beat Walsall 2–-0, becoming the only side to have won the competition three times. He was a regular in the City side that confirmed promotion to the Championship with three games of the season still to go.

Blackburn Rovers
On 26 August 2016, Williams joined Championship club Blackburn Rovers on a three-year contract. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Cardiff City where he found the equaliser in the 90th minute of the match. In his first season with the club, he managed to make 39 appearances in the league and 3 in the FA Cup. He was also named as the Player of the Season.

International career
Williams is eligible to play for Germany, the United States, and the Republic of Ireland. In February 2011, Williams made his debut for the Republic of Ireland U19 team against Croatia U19, before going onto play in three of Ireland's four fixtures of the UEFA Under-19 Championships later that year. On 10 September 2012, Williams made his debut for the Republic of Ireland U21 team, in a 4–2 victory over Italy U21.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,Defender,,,,,,,1.80 m (5 ft 11 in),163 lbs,0,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/8o22yf1511365250.jpg,,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/gsilqd1757876243.png,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/rdduib1652355246.png,,,,,,No,unlocked,Williams,Reading,EPL
